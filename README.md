**Turret Lock** is a client side mod that allows a vehicle's gunner to lock the turret close to wherever he is looking at the moment.
If the mod can't properly detect where the gunner is looking, it will lock the turret looking forwards.

<h2>CBA Keybinds</h2>

* Press **Alt-U** to lock the turret.

<h2>Known Incompatibility</h2>
This means that it will just lock looking forwards:

* Redd n Tanks: Gepard
