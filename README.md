**Turret Lock** is a client side mod that allows users to lock turret stabilisation as well as to make the turret face forward along the hull.
This does ***NOT*** lock the turret onto a target, it only locks the turret in a specific direction relative to the vehicle's hull.

<h2>CBA Keybinds</h2>

* Press **Alt-U** to lock the turret stabilisation. Only works if player is in the "Gunner" view (using the sights).
* Press **Ctrl-Alt-U** to lock the turret facing forward along hull. Works in any view (1st person, 3rd person, etc.).
