**Turret Lock** is a client side mod that allows a vehicle's gunner to lock the turret close to wherever he is looking at the moment or to make the turret face forward along the hull.

<h2>CBA Keybinds</h2>

* Press **Alt-U** to lock the turret. Only works if player is in the "Gunner" view (using the sights).
* Press **Ctrl-Alt-U** to lock the turret facing forward along hull. Works in any view (1st person, 3rd person, etc.).
